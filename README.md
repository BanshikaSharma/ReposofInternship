# Task Extraction from Unstructured Text

## Overview

This project implements a Natural Language Processing (NLP) pipeline to extract and categorize tasks from unstructured text. The system identifies sentences that contain tasks, extracts relevant entities (who is responsible for the task and when it should be completed), and presents the information in a structured format.

## Features

- Preprocesses input text to remove unnecessary characters and standardize formatting.
- Identifies sentences that contain tasks based on specific keywords.
- Extracts entities such as the person responsible for the task and any deadlines associated with it.
- Outputs a structured list of tasks with associated entities.

## Technologies Used

- Python
- NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit)
- Scikit-learn (for accuracy evaluation)
- Matplotlib (for visualizations)
